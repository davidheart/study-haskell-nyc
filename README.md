# New York Haskell Study Group

Starting in September 2016, we will work through [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki. The only prerequisites for participating are this book, a computer, and your person. An open mind is also recommended. No prior experience with Haskell, functional programming, or coding in general is required.

To prepare for your first visit, please do the following (as much as you can):

- **Purchase your own copy of the book**
You will need your own copy on your own machine so you can work with the PDF and your terminal open side-by-side. This book was independently researched, written, and published by two Haskell developers working in their spare time to support education in functional programming. As an aspiring member of our strong and supportive community, we know you are too committed to the spirit of pure actions to "borrow" someone else's copy. They typeset it with LaTeX: give them a break!

- **Install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), the Haskell project development tool**
If you are familiar with package managers like npm, pip, and apt, Stack is similar. You needn't show up already an expert, but do at least learn the basics. If you want to know everything, though, you could watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRonIB8ZStw). The most important thing: whatever you do, _do not install the Haskell Platform_.

- **Prepare a new project with Stack for your exercise files, and familiarize yourself with GHC and GHCi**
You don't need to do much more than create a directory for your code and make sure you know how to run the GHC compiler on your source files and GHCi when you need a REPL.

- **Read each chapter all the way through and do as many of the exercises as you can before each meeting, including the first meeting**
Since we'll be learning Haskell together in this group, it is essential that you work through each chapter on your own first so that you come prepared knowing what you need help with _and_ what you understand well enough to teach others. If you get stuck on a problem, keep moving, but do not just skip the exercises entirely.
#### For the sake of emphasis: _do not skip the exercises!_

**Note**: _If you are a complete beginner to programming or for whatever reason have trouble installing Haskell on your computer, don't worry about it! Come to the study group, and we'll help you figure it out. Fortunately, you don't even need a computer to work through Chapter 1â€”just pen and paper and patience. So make sure you at least do that much, even if you require tech support._

## Logistics

### Format

We will work through the book at the pace of roughly a chapter a week, meeting for about 2 hours. This is not a class, however, so do not come expecting a lecture. Instead, you will have the opportunity to discuss concepts and exercises that gave you difficulty when working through the chapter on your own. You are encouraged to hew as closely to this regular, weekly schedule as you are able so as to maintain your momentum. That said, if life gets in the way, so be it: but do your best to catch up, and avoid skipping any material as each chapter builds on the last. Did we mention that you _should not under any circumstances whatsoever skip the exercises?_ Just making sure!

### Meeting Location

TBA

### Tentative Schedule

Make sure you [sign up](http://bit.ly/study-haskell-nyc) for the study group to receive confirmations about dates and times. You should also consider joining the [New York Haskell Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/), where this information will also be posted.

First meeting - date and time TBA
